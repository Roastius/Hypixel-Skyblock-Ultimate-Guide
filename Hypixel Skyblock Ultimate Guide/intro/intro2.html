                  We are at the second part of the tutorial to get money. There are many ways to get money early game, but bazaar flipping is the best way to get money quickly.
                Although bazaar flipping is really good to get money, is it a little bit confusing for brand new players, and if you don't do it well, you could actually lose money.
              </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Head over to the bazaar and right click on the npc. Here you can buy and sell items you will collect along the way, such as wheat, stone, and much more.
                    You can use this to gain money. Hover over some of the items you can buy, and try to find an item which has a buy price way higher than the sell price, or the sell price way lower than the buy price.
                    Click on the item you have found. You can create a buy order and a sell offer. The buy order will cost as much as the sell prive, and a sell offer will cost as much as the buy price.
                    Create a buy order and click the golden nugget to make the order fill first. Wait for it to fill all the way, then click the chest in the bazaar menu to open your current orders, and collect your items. 
                    Put those same items into a sell offer, and again, click the gold nugget to complete the offer fastser. Once it fills, ollect the coins. 
                    You have just done your first bazaar flip.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    This still might be a little bit confusing, so let me show you an example.
                    Lets say i want to bazaar flip cobblestone. The instant buy price is 6 coins, and the instant sell price is 3 coins.
                    I put up a buy offer of 10 cobblestone. This will cost 30 coins, since the buy offer price is the same as the instant sell price.
                    Once it fills I collect my 10 cobblestone, then put up a sell offer, and since a sell offer is the same as the instant buy price, I will get 60 coins back.
                    This is a really good flip, since i started with 30 coins and ended with 60. Sometimes though, it can be really hard to find an item that will buy and sell quickly, and one that gives a lot of profit.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    There is also a few other methods using the bazaar where you can instantly get a lot of money early game, but you can only do them once a day.
                    Head over to the builder and buy as much packed ice as you can possibly can, then instant sell all the packed ice to the bazaar. This alone will give you around 25k.
                    You can do this from other items from other npcs, such as the adventurer or the lumber merchant, but it's really hard to find an item that sells for more than amount you bought it for,
                     since most of the time it's cheaper to buy an item from the bazaar than an npc.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Do this a lot, and you can get money really quickly. Some really experienced bazaar flippers still bazaar flip even in late game!
